Liu Xiaobo, a human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, died on 13th July. 

The earliest news came out around 9 pm (GMT), When my Wechat and Weibo were flooded by memorial pictures (overturned 90 or 180 degrees), 
poets and music with profound meaning. 

By the next day, some related Posts in Wechat could be seen for seconds, then disappeared. It's not 
hard to feel that the censorship technique is keeping pace with the resistant tricks, and the former wins again and again.

[The Citizen Lab published a report concerning this](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/07/analyzing-censorship-of-the-death-of-liu-xiaobo-on-wechat-and-weibo/) on 16th July. I am quite impressed by the fast responding. In this report, it compares
the scope of censorship before and after Liu's death. It also dicovers some up-dated censored measures in Wechat and Weibo.
It's quite worth reading.

Their key findings:

  > the scope of censorship of keywords and images on WeChat related to Liu Xiaobo expanded greatly after his death. 
  > Our analysis of WeChat keyword-based censorship shows that after his death messages containing his name in 
  > English and in both simplified and traditional Chinese are blocked. His death is also the first time we 
  > see image filtering in one-to-one chat, in addition to image filtering in group chats and WeChat moments.
  
  > Sina Weibo maintains a ban on searches for Liu Xiaobo’s name in English and Chinese (both simplified and traditional).
  > However, since his passing, his given name (Xiaobo) alone is enough to trigger censorship, showing increased censorship 
  > on the platform and a recognition that his passing is a particularly sensitive event.
  
  > Based on an initial analysis of Weibo’s suggested search keywords, we surmise that there continues to be genuine user 
  > interest in producing and finding Liu-related content using alternative keywords.


Another things is the increasing force-out of VPN service in mainland. [News came out](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-10/china-is-said-to-order-carriers-to-bar-personal-vpns-by-february) in mid-July that
the Chinese government has notified telecom operators to truncate individual users' access to virtual private networks (VPNs) 
by February 1, 2018. Soon after, many developers of VPN tools were questioned by the police, and forced to withdraw their 
publication. Today( 29th July), [Apple made a statement](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-apple-vpn-idUSKBN1AE0BQ) to the VPN service provider that Apple's App Store (China version) will 
remove all VPN apps off shelves because **it involves local laws and regulations**. Many people had fluke mind when the 
Cybersecurity Law was passed in last years National People's Congress. But it seems very serious this time.

The history of internet censorship started from 1994, my colleagues did [a very good brief picture](http://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/2017/06/ngocn-%E4%BA%92%E8%81%94%E7%BD%91%E6%96%B0%E8%A7%84%E5%AE%9E%E6%96%BD-%E4%B8%80%E8%B5%B7%E5%9B%9E%E9%A1%BE%E8%BF%87%E5%8E%BB23%E5%B9%B4%E7%9A%84404%E5%8F%B2/) about it.
How to evaluate its performance? Liu Xiaobo's woeful story could explain something. The night when he passed away, I was hanging out with 3 friends, who have access to internet since 90s, but not regularly
using VPN to avoid censorship. None of them know Liu Xiaobo. One mentioned that she saw this name from the posts I share in Wechat,
but she never successful opened it, they were deleted so fast.
