# Further Control on Cultural Market? Chaos before 19th National Congress

From 2012 onwards, China's political environment tightened quickly. From the control of civil society to the further suppression of human rights defenders, the turn of the Chinese political atmosphere has become a fact that everyone knows.

However, the progress of this year is surprising. Strict control has spread in a more visible way. I spent some time for the vacation in China in June and July 2017. The first news I received after getting off the plane was the elimination of hundreds entertainment social media accounts. These medias had accumulated huge amounts of readers and attracted million dollars of VC funds. Before long, SARFT（广电总局） issued a red head file, asked for a suspension of  all costume drama, idol drama and other highly entertaining TV series during the 19th National Congress, idol drama and other highly entertaining TV series, and recommended the "generals" "sharp attack" and other revolutionary, military theme dramas for this period. Then, by the middle of July, European/American (or Western) and Japanese film and television works were deleted from animation video sites, although some of them were legally introduced and copyrighted. Right after I leave China, It is reported that in Beijing and Guangzhou metros, police checks passengers mobile phone by [invasive tools]() , passengers will be taken away once found the video and documents of terrorist attacks in their phone.

The oppression of freedom of expression is nothing new here. However, It used to confine to the political arena. Closing rights-based NGOs, arresting human rights defenders, blocking foreign news sources and eliminating disharmony "public intellectual" voices, regrettably speaking, these events are usually not very influential under such strict media and internet censorship. It is worth mentioning that earlier this year, some Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korean stars have been blocked because of political reasons, causing a small range of dissatisfaction within the fans, however, "when it comes to the nation, there is no idol" is the mainstream opinion and has become a popular slogan.

This time, the enhancing controlling on the cultural market seems different. It marks the deepening of intrusion into personal lives, and further underminds the privacy right and property rights. Another different thing might be the resentful feedback it raises. Many social media accounts in Weibo were canceled or banned because of criticizing those policies, despite the fact that there is no real action yet.

 "when it comes to the nation, there is no (foreign) idol", How about "when it comes to the nation, there is no self-choice entertainment"?
 
To be honest, this new series of policies makes me confused. They don't show much consistency with the previous strategies, namely separation and atomization. It almost looks like testing the bottom lines and preparing for some further moves after 19th Nation Congress.

This also makes me think of the what Prof. PEI Minxin said in [a recent interview from FT](http://www.ftchinese.com/story/001073404?full=y):

> FT中文网：到目前为止，您曾想过要修正之前的研究或对中国的看法吗？
> 裴敏欣：研究上，我们往往低估的并不仅仅是政权的能力，而是中国人民能在这样的环境下创造出那么多的财富。这其实也是西方理论的误区，虽然从理论上认识到集体行动的困境和难度，但往往没有充分理解到一般人对专制体制的容忍度。

> Financial Times China: So far, have you ever wanted to revise your previous research or view of China?
> PEI Minxin: In the study, we often underestimated not only the power of the regime, but the Chinese people in such an environment to create so much wealth.
> This is actually the misunderstanding of Western theory, although theoretically aware of the plight and difficulty of collective action, but often did not fully understand the tolerance of the authoritarian system.

Could this become (part of) the final straw? It doesn't look like this way. But I think this is an important puzzle in China's last-round chaos. I talked to my ex-colleagues and friends in China, their opinions could be representative and might show some insights. And I will try to write them later.
