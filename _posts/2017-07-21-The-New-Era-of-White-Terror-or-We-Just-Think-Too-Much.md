# The New Era of White Terror? Or We Just Think Too Much

From 2012 onwards, China's political environment tightened quickly. From the control of civil society to the further suppression of human rights defenders, the turn of the Chinese political atmosphere has become a fact that everyone knows.

However, the progress of this year is surprising. Strict control has spread in a more visible way. I spent some time for the vacation in China in June and July 2017. The first news I received after getting off the plane was the elimination of hundreds entertainment social media accounts. These medias had accumulated huge amounts of readers who just want to have some fun by following celebrity gossip or chasing stars. Before long, European/American (or Western) film and television works were deleted from two famous animation video sites. Right after I left China, WhatsApp was blocked by the GFW, the control on VPNs is upgrading in an efficiency beyond imagination.

The oppression of freedom of expression is nothing new here. However, It used to confine to the political arena. Closing rights-based NGOs, arresting human rights defenders, blocking foreign news sources and eliminating disharmony "public intellectual" voices, regrettably speaking, these events are usually not very influential under such strict media and internet censorship. Even the death of Nobel Laureate LIU Xiaobo wasn't reported by any mainstream media and didn't raise much discussion within ordinary people. But these new methods of controlling the cultural market apparently raised many feedbacks with resentment.

To be honest, this new trends confused me. It doesn't show much consistency with the previous strategies, namely seperation and atomization. It almost looks like testing the bottom lines and preparing for some unimaginative moves.

I talked to my ex-colleagues and friends, their opinions could be representative and might show some insights. 

I will try to put them into three categories.

### How People Within the System think?

### Is There Still a Civil Society?

### My Little Pink Friends.
