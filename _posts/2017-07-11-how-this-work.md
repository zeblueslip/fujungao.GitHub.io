# How this work

This is an experimental blog, for recording and sharing what I have learned, see and hear. I have not thought of a suitable name, so it is just **A BLOG**

I am currently studying Sciences Po, major in Human rights. I have a number of interest, which I will share about in this Blog, including:

  - Social movements and civil society in Aisa,
  - Human rights,
  - Internet censorship,
  - Online nationalism.

Also,I am living in Paris and learning French. Hopefully one day I can write this blog in French.
