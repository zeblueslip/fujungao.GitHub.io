title: A New Torture 
---

I have been quite busy these days: Had my family visited in Paris; Working on 3 projects at the same time, and still looking for internship opportunity in Paris.

The most recent and time-consuming project is building a blog/website for censored reports of my previous organization. It requires a lot of coordination and I need to learn a lot of new things related to IT, which is fun and exciting. I will link that blog/website here when it finish.

I have to confess that I didn’t read much since August, except several papers about Union democracy in US, which are required by my reading webinar and I guess I would have something to say about them after the serious webinars finish. The best article I have seen recently is A New Torture by Eva Pils, Published in [China Policy Institute: Analysis])(https://cpianalysis.org/2017/08/10/a-new-torture-in-china/amp/) last week.

Eva Pils is a professor in King’s College in London, I have tried to interview her in German-China civil society, She is very friendly and helpful. I admire her most of her book on [Wei-Quan lawyers in China](https://www.amazon.com/Chinas-Human-Rights-Lawyers-Resistance/dp/0415870844). 

The new article is clearly a continuation of this book. It discusses the new trends/measures of using torture for political prisoners by analyzing the 709 cases. Many lawyer were reported to force to take medicine during the detention and at least one lawyer show  signs of serious mental illness after more than 500 days detention. From my own sources, several activist, not only 709 lawyers, suffer with anxiety and depression after “release”, and some also started using violence against their family, which are new situations (or at least are not being discussed before).

The abuses in health-care settings with detainees are disturbing. When we talk about Non-violent non-cooperative political prisoners, we always think about Gandhi and his spiritual practices in prison, which provide him the power of insistence. But what if he was forced to take psychiatric drugs？How can we prepare for this, and what can we do for those released people who suffer mentally？
