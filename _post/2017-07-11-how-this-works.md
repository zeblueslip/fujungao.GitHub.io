This is an experimental blog, for recording and sharing what I see, learn and think. 

I have not thought of a suitable name, so it is just **A BLOG**.

I am currently studying in Sciences Po, majoring in Human rights. I have a number of interest, which I will share in this Blog, including:

  - Social movements and civil society in Aisa,
  - Human rights,
  - Internet censorship,
  - Online nationalism.

Also,I am living in Paris and learning French. Hopefully one day I can write this blog in French.

Thanks for reading.
